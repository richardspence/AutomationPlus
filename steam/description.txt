[h2]Random number generator[/h2]
Randomly sets the output bits on a ribbon when the control signal is set.

This gate can delay the input signal for up to the alloted amount of time.

How is this different than a buffer gate?  Buffer gates become stuck "on" after the alotment of time.  They also reset the wait time on every red signal.  The delay gate delays both red and green signals the specified amount of time on all bits if ribbons are used.

[h2]4-bit Arithmentic logical unit (ALU)[/h2]

The 4-bit ALU can perform math operations on two 4-bit inputs.  The ALU can accept both signed ([url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement]Two's complement[/url]) or unsigned numbers.

Operator can be selected manually or dynamically via the operator port.

Operatos supported include:
 - addition/subtraction
 - multiplication/division
 - modulus
 - exponents
 - bitshifts
 - equals/not-equals
 - greaterThan / lessThan
 - unary increment

[h2]8-bit ALU[/h2]
Same as the 4-bit variety, only with twice the inputs.

[h2]Display Adaptor[/h2]
The display adaptor is an automation building that takes a 4-bit signal and converts that into 5 ribbon outputs for use to display the values.

The adaptor supports both displaying hexadecimal inputs as well as a decimal values with additional codes reserved for having the pixel packs fully on/off.
